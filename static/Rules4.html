9) Health Calculation
</b></h2>
<p>
  When two (or more) pieces are side by side a melee is formed. The health of all pieces is recalculated on every move during
  a turn. Any piece with a negative health is due to be captured at the end of the turn. Such a piece changes color to grey.
  As further pieces are added to a melee, a grey piece due to be captured, may recover it&apos;s health and have it&apos;s color 
  restored. Just as a reminder:
  <ul>
    <li>A piece is said to be &quot;flying&quot; a colour if that colour is one of the two colours shown on the current top face.</li>
    <li>A piece is said to be &quot;empowered&quot; if it stands on a hexagon of it&apos;s own body colour.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This section shows how the health algorithm works and the following sections give a few example melees.
</p>

<div class="rowM1">
  <div class="columnM1">
    <p>
      Consider two pieces side by side. There is just one common edge / border. Here is the logic table for calculating the health
      for each piece. Since a hexagon has six sides, and each conflict is bidrectional, up to twelve contributing factors from this
      logic table may be added together to determine the health of a particular piece, according to how many other pieces are adjacent.

  Assuming this scenario was the result of the cylinders turn, the health algorithm would have been repeatedly executed.
  The red block and the yellow block would have become grey, indicating that they have been captured. Once the turn ends, 
  the captors, namely the yellow and red cylinders would gain an extra move. Meanwhile, the captives return to their home
  positions and the score is updated accordingly.

  Assuming this scenario was the result of the blocks turn, the health algorithm would have been repeatedly executed.
  The orange cylinder and the green cylinder would have become grey, indicating that they have been captured. Once the turn ends, 
  the captors, namely the green, yellow and blue blocks would gain an extra move. Meanwhile, the captives return to their home
  positions and the score is updated accordingly.

<h2><b>
  11) Captors and Captives
</b></h2>


<div class="rowM1">
  <div class="columnM1">
    As before, the algorithm computes the health of each piece. With this scenario at the end of a turn, there are two captives 
    and three captors. Both the blue block and the yellow cylinder are captured, they would become grey during the turn. At the 
    end of the turn both would return to their home positions. However, only one side gets to claim the extra move(s) assoicated 
    with being a captor. In this example, if this scenario was created by the ...
    <ul>
      <li>Cylinder Player ... then the yellow cylinder may make an extra move from it&apos;s home position.</li>
      <li>Block Player ... then the blue block may make an extra move from it&apos;s home position <b>and</b> the orange block may 
        may make an extra move from it's current position.
      </li>
